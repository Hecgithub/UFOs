# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of the analysis was to create a dynamic webpage that displayed the findings of UFO sightings and allowed users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Users of the website could easily research UFO sightings by city, state, country, and shape.  
    
## Results:
The webpage offers a unique way to research UFO sightings around the country.

The search boxes allow the users to look for specific data where they can make correlations of sightings that happen around the country. The page can be reset by clicking the top left corner.

The functionality of the search table works by hitting “enter” on the keyboard. Everything is simplified to do a quick easy search in a large amount of complex data. As an example of the multiple filter search we can look at all the sightings in a specific day as seen below.

Then the search can be drilled down even further to only return the sightings in Texas as seen below.

This is a great functionality to have to conduct further analysis of the given data. 

## Summary:

The drawback to the site is that the user must know exactly what specific criteria they are looking for. The site can be updated to have more functionality and search data within a range of dates. There is also a duration criterion where a filter can be added to search specific durations of the sightings.
